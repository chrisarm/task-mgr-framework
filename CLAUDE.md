# task-mgr Project Notes

## Database Location

The Ralph loop database is at `.task-mgr/tasks.db` (relative to the project/worktree root). Each worktree has its own copy.

## Worktrees

- Main: `$HOME/projects/task-mgr`
- Feature worktrees: `$HOME/projects/task-mgr-worktrees/<branch-name>/`

## Task Files

- PRD task lists: `.task-mgr/tasks/<prd-name>.json`
- Loop prompts: `.task-mgr/tasks/<prd-name>-prompt.md`
- Progress log: `.task-mgr/tasks/progress.txt`

## Model IDs and Effort Mapping

All Claude model IDs and the difficulty→effort mapping live in a single file:
`src/loop_engine/model.rs` (`OPUS_MODEL` / `SONNET_MODEL` / `HAIKU_MODEL` constants
and the `EFFORT_FOR_DIFFICULTY` table). After bumping a value there:

```sh
cargo run --bin gen-docs   # regenerates the MODELS block in .claude/commands/tasks.md
```

CI runs `cargo run --bin gen-docs -- --check` which fails if the doc is stale.
Tests import the constants; JSON fixtures use `{{OPUS_MODEL}}` placeholders in
`tests/fixtures/*.json.tmpl` rendered at load time by
`tests/common/mod.rs::render_fixture_tmpl`. A regression test
(`tests/no_hardcoded_models.rs`) ensures literal model strings don't creep back
in outside `model.rs`.

## `task-mgr models` subcommand

List and pin Claude models:

```sh
task-mgr models list                     # offline — built-in model IDs + effort table
task-mgr models list --remote            # live /v1/models (requires both env vars below)
task-mgr models list --refresh           # busts cache before fetch; implies --remote
task-mgr models set-default [<model>]    # prompts interactively when model omitted
task-mgr models set-default <id> --project   # writes .task-mgr/config.json instead
task-mgr models unset-default [--project]
task-mgr models show                     # resolved default + source label
```

**Remote opt-in** (prevents surprise HTTP calls on a globally-exported SDK key):

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — your Anthropic API key
- `TASK_MGR_USE_API=1` — explicit opt-in; both must be set or we silently fall
  back to the built-in list

Cache: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/task-mgr/models-cache.json` (24h TTL, stale treated as miss).

**Config locations & precedence** (highest to lowest): explicit task `model` →
`difficulty==high` → PRD `defaultModel` → `.task-mgr/config.json defaultModel`
→ `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/task-mgr/config.json defaultModel` → none.
`difficulty==high` always escalates to `OPUS_MODEL`, independent of any
default.

The interactive picker fires from `task-mgr init` (project-level scaffold) and
from the deprecated `task-mgr init --from-json X` shim path when nothing
resolves and stdin+stderr are both TTYs. Non-TTY / auto-mode runs print a
one-line stderr hint and skip — no hang. The picker does NOT fire from
`task-mgr loop init` or `task-mgr batch init` directly.

## Loop CLI Cheat Sheet

- **Add a task**: `echo '{"id":"X-FIX-001","title":"...","difficulty":"medium","touchesFiles":[]}' | task-mgr add --stdin`
- **Link into milestone**: append `--depended-on-by MILESTONE-ID`
- **Mark status**: emit `<task-status>TASK-ID:done</task-status>` (also: `failed`, `skipped`, `irrelevant`, `blocked`)
- **Permission guard**: loop iterations deny Edit/Write on `tasks/*.json` via `--disallowedTools`
- **Never edit** `.task-mgr/tasks/*.json` directly — use the CLI and tags above
- **Spawn-fixup PRD targeting**: the loop now exports `TASK_MGR_ACTIVE_PREFIX` and `task-mgr add --stdin` auto-prefixes new task IDs + their `dependsOn` / `--depended-on-by` targets to the active PRD — bare IDs (`FIX-001`) and fully-prefixed IDs both work. Cross-PRD IDs (those starting with a different known PRD's prefix) are rejected with a hard error. For human invocations outside a loop (where `TASK_MGR_ACTIVE_PREFIX` may not be set), you must still disambiguate manually. When a CODE-REVIEW or MILESTONE iteration spawns ad-hoc fixup tasks (`CODE-FIX-`, `WIRE-FIX-`, `IMPL-FIX-`, `REFACTOR-N-`), the `task-mgr add --stdin` invocation MUST disambiguate the destination PRD or the entry leaks into whatever PRD JSON the CLI defaults to. Two reliable forms: (a) pass `--from-json tasks/<correct-prd>.json`, or (b) pipe `--depended-on-by <milestone-of-correct-prd>` so the prefix is unambiguous from the dependency edge. Symptom of getting it wrong: orphan `passes: false` placeholders showing up in an unrelated PRD's JSON during merge-back review (real example: this PRD's CODE-REVIEW-1 spawned `WIRE-FIX-001`/`CODE-FIX-002` into `loop-reliability.json`; the actual fix landed correctly under REFACTOR-N tasks, but the misfiled placeholders persisted as cosmetic drift).
- **PRD JSON lives in two places — sync both before re-launching a loop**: `tasks/<feature>.json` exists in BOTH the main repo AND the worktree the loop runs in. The loop reads the **worktree's** copy on each iteration ("PRD file changed, re-importing tasks..."). Editing the main-repo JSON via `Edit` + `task-mgr loop init tasks/<feature>.json --append --update-existing` from the main repo refreshes the main DB once, but the loop will silently re-import the stale worktree copy on its next iteration, undoing the edit. Reliable fix: `cp tasks/<feature>.json <worktree>/tasks/<feature>.json` before re-launching, OR edit the worktree's copy directly. Verify by jq-comparing `.userStories[] | select(.id=="X") | .acceptanceCriteria` between both locations.
- **Soft-dep guard tokenizer false-positive on AC cross-references**: `src/commands/next/selection.rs::mentioned_fixup_prefixes` tokenizes ACs on `[A-Z0-9-]` and matches `token.starts_with("{prefix}-")` for `SPAWNED_FIXUP_PREFIXES` (`REFACTOR-N`, `CODE-FIX`, `WIRE-FIX`, `IMPL-FIX`). A non-self-fixup task whose AC mentions e.g. `CODE-FIX-002` as a standalone token will be **deferred indefinitely** while any same-prefix sibling is active — even if that sibling depends on the deferred task (deadlock). Bypass: write the cross-reference as `<prd-prefix>-CODE-FIX-002` so it tokenizes as one fully-prefixed token, OR rephrase to not name the sibling at all (e.g., "the implementation task" instead of "CODE-FIX-002"). Description and notes fields are NOT scanned — ACs only. Found in unify-execution-followups; deadlocked TEST-INIT-001 ↔ CODE-FIX-002.

## Deprecation policy

`task-mgr init --from-json <prd>` is a **permanent shim** — it will not be removed. Operators who use it today (scripts, docs, muscle memory) can continue to do so indefinitely. The shim prints a one-line stderr notice and dispatches to `task-mgr loop init` (N=1) or `task-mgr batch init` (N>1) after running `init_project`, so the DB state is byte-for-byte identical to the canonical path.

Canonical forms for new scripts and docs:

| Old (deprecated, still valid) | New (canonical) |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| `task-mgr init --from-json prd.json` | `task-mgr init && task-mgr loop init prd.json` |
| `task-mgr init --from-json 'tasks/*.json'` | `task-mgr init && task-mgr batch init 'tasks/*.json'` |
| `task-mgr init --from-json prd.json --append --update-existing` | `task-mgr loop init prd.json --append --update-existing` |

See PRD §11 (shim permanence) for the rationale.

## Auto-launch /review-loop after loop end

After a clean loop exit (all tasks complete), `task-mgr` can spawn an interactive
`claude "/review-loop tasks/<prd>.md"` session automatically. The user lands directly
in the review without a manual hand-off step.

**Default behavior**: fires when `autoReview: true` (default) AND `tasks_completed >= autoReviewMinTasks`
(default 3). Both live in `.task-mgr/config.json`. An empty config means both defaults apply.

**CLI overrides** (clap-enforced mutual exclusion):
- `--auto-review` — force on; treats the task-count threshold as 1
- `--no-auto-review` — force off unconditionally

**Batch mode**: ONE review fires at end-of-batch for the LAST successful PRD that met the
threshold — never per-PRD. Earlier PRDs in the batch are skipped even if they individually
qualified.

**Suppression cases** (prints a recovery hint, continues, exit code unchanged):
- Non-TTY stdout (CI, pipes) — hint: re-run interactively to get the review
- `tasks/<prd>.md` not found AND `tasks/prd-<stem>.md` not found — hint: name the markdown file to match
- Worktree path missing or cleaned up — hint: re-run `claude "/review-loop tasks/<prd>.md"` manually

**Process model**: `Command::status()` — blocking spawn, stdin/stdout/stderr inherit so the
review session is fully interactive. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and other env vars inherit automatically.

**Module**: `src/loop_engine/auto_review.rs` — `Decision`, `resolve_decision`, `should_fire`,
`ReviewLauncher` trait, `maybe_fire`.

**Invariant**: auto-review failure NEVER changes the loop or batch exit code.

**Known footgun — paths with whitespace**: `ProcessLauncher::launch`
(`src/loop_engine/auto_review.rs:130`) interpolates the PRD path into a single
slash-command argv element: `format!("/review-loop {}", md.display())`. Claude
re-tokenizes the slash-command body on whitespace, so a PRD path containing
spaces (e.g. `tasks/My PRD.md`) splits into multiple tokens and the review
launch fails to find the file. Not a security issue (no shell, `Command::arg`
is safe), but project convention is space-free `tasks/<feature>.md` paths for
exactly this reason — keep it that way. If the Claude CLI grows a structured
args form, prefer that over in-band quoting.

`maybe_fire` enforces this convention with a launch-boundary guard: if the
resolved markdown path contains any `char::is_whitespace` character, the
launch is suppressed and a stderr hint tells the operator to rename the file
and re-run `/review-loop` manually. The guard sits AFTER `prd_md_path` (so it
sees the actual file we'd hand to Claude) and BEFORE `launcher.launch` (so
no fragmented argv ever reaches `claude`). It deliberately does not attempt
to quote or escape — quoting Claude's slash-command body is brittle, and
suppression with a clear hint is the simpler, more honest contract.

**Outer/inner split for test reachability**: `maybe_fire` is a thin
wrapper that performs the TTY pre-check and delegates to
`maybe_fire_inner` (`pub(crate)`), which contains every launch-decision
gate (decision, worktree existence, markdown path resolution, whitespace
guard, launcher dispatch). `cargo test` runs in a non-TTY env, so a unit
test that goes through the public `maybe_fire` would short-circuit at
the TTY gate before reaching any inner gate — meaning a test asserting
"this guard suppresses launch" via `CapturingLauncher` would pass even
if the guard were deleted. Tests for inner-side gates
(`maybe_fire_inner_*`) call the inner function directly to bypass the
TTY gate and exercise the real guard logic; a single
`maybe_fire_outer_suppresses_in_non_tty` test exercises the outer
wrapper to prove the TTY gate still fires. When adding a new
launch-boundary guard, add it inside `maybe_fire_inner` and test it via
the inner — never via the outer.

## Overflow recovery and diagnostics

When the Claude CLI subprocess returns "Prompt is too long", the loop engine
walks a **four-rung recovery ladder** and writes a diagnostics bundle. Entry
point: `overflow::handle_prompt_too_long` in `src/loop_engine/overflow.rs`,
called from the `PromptTooLong` arm of `run_iteration` in
`src/loop_engine/engine.rs`.

**The ladder** (in order; first rung whose precondition is met wins):

1. **Downgrade effort** — `model::downgrade_effort` (`xhigh → high`). Effort
   never drops below `high` (see `escalate_below_opus` rustdoc on the high-effort
   floor invariant).
2. **Escalate model below Opus** — `model::escalate_below_opus`
   (`haiku → sonnet`, `sonnet → opus`). Closes the Sonnet-default gap that
   used to immediately block the loop on iteration 1.
3. **Escalate to 1M-context Opus** — `model::to_1m_model` (`opus → opus[1m]`).
4. **Block** — task status set to `blocked`; no further recovery attempts.

Rungs 1-3 reset the task status to `todo` (and clear `started_at`) so the next
iteration retries with the override applied; rung 4 sets `blocked`.

**Diagnostics bundle (best-effort; failures log via `eprintln!` and never
propagate)**:

- **Prompt dump**: written to
  `.task-mgr/overflow-dumps/<sanitized-task-id>-iter<n>-<unix-ts>.txt`. Contains
  metadata + per-section byte breakdown + dropped sections + the raw assembled
  prompt. Task IDs are sanitized via `overflow::sanitize_id_for_filename`
  (path-traversal defense; `..` collapsed before allowlist filtering).
- **JSONL event log**: appended one-line-per-event to
  `.task-mgr/overflow-events.jsonl`. Each line is a serialized
  `OverflowEvent` (`ts`, `task_id`, `run_id`, `iteration`, `model`, `effort`,
  `prompt_bytes`, `sections`, `dropped_sections`, `recovery`, `dump_path`).
  `sections` is an ordered JSON array of `[name, size]` pairs (NOT a map).
  `recovery` is a tagged object with discriminator field `action` and
  variant-specific siblings (e.g. `{"action": "escalate_model", "new_model": "..."}`).
- **Rotation**: keeps newest 3 dumps per task ID via
  `overflow::rotate_dumps_keep_n`. Each entry (unreadable dir entry, missing
  metadata, failed deletion) is logged and skipped independently so a single
  IO error never aborts the rest of the rotation pass.

**Banner annotation**: when a task is mid-recovery, the iteration banner emits
`(overflow recovery from <original-model>)` next to the model line. The banner
gates on `IterationContext::overflow_recovered` (a `HashSet<String>` of task
IDs that have hit the overflow handler at least once), NOT on `model_overrides`
— see learning #893: crash escalation and consecutive-failure escalation must
stay in their own channels. The original model is captured first-overflow only
via `IterationContext::overflow_original_model.entry().or_insert_with(...)`.

**Order of operations is contractual** (do not reorder):
ctx update → DB UPDATE → stderr → dump → JSONL → rotate. Recovery state must
be durable before any best-effort observability writes.

## Learning Creation Chokepoint

All production code paths that create learnings must go through `LearningWriter` in
`src/learnings/crud/writer.rs`. This ensures every new learning automatically gets an
Ollama embedding scheduled (best-effort, graceful degradation when Ollama is down).

**Pattern:**
1. Construct `LearningWriter::new(db_dir)` — pass `Some(path)` for embedding, `None` in tests.
2. Call `writer.record(conn, params)` (or `writer.push_existing(id, title, content)` for
   callers like `merge_cluster` that do their own `record_learning` inside a transaction).
3. Call `writer.flush(conn)` **after** any enclosing transaction has committed — this is
   where the Ollama HTTP call happens. Never flush inside a `rusqlite::Transaction`.

**Production paths using LearningWriter:**
- `learn()` in `src/commands/learn.rs`
- `import_learnings()` in `src/commands/import_learnings/mod.rs`
- `curate_dedup()` in `src/commands/curate/mod.rs` (via `push_existing` after `merge_cluster`)
- `extract_learnings_from_output()` in `src/learnings/ingestion/mod.rs` (loop engine path)

The low-level `record_learning()` primitive in `src/learnings/crud/create.rs` is still
public for tests and `curate enrich`, but new production creation paths should use
`LearningWriter` to get automatic embedding scheduling.

## Learning Supersession

When a newer learning replaces an older one, the link is tracked in the
`learning_supersessions` join table (migration v17). The old row is retained (for
audit / history) but auto-filtered from recall by default.

- **Create a supersession**: `task-mgr learn --supersedes <old-id> ...` or
  `task-mgr edit-learning <new-id> --supersedes <old-id>`. The old learning's
  confidence is downgraded to `low` and a row is inserted into
  `learning_supersessions(old_id, new_id, superseded_at)`.
- **Recall behavior**: `task-mgr recall` excludes superseded learnings by default.
  Pass `--include-superseded` to see them. Filtering happens in
  `retrieval/mod.rs::passes_query_filters()` via a shared SQL helper — all three
  backends (fts5, patterns, vector) honor the flag.
- **Listing**: `task-mgr learnings` annotates rows with `(superseded by #N)` and
  `(supersedes #M)`.
- See `task-mgr learn --help`, `task-mgr edit-learning --help`,
  `task-mgr recall --help` for flag details.

**Invariants for future maintainers:**

- **`apply_supersession` runs AFTER `LearningWriter::flush`** in `learn()` — the
  new learning's `id` is only known post-insert. In `edit_learning()` the id is
  known upfront so `apply_supersession` can run before/after other field edits;
  it runs after so typo'd `--supersedes` values don't roll back unrelated edits.
- **Single source for the filter SQL**: `pub(crate) const SUPERSESSION_SUBQUERY`
  in `src/learnings/retrieval/mod.rs` is the canonical `NOT IN (SELECT
  old_learning_id FROM learning_supersessions)` fragment. All retrieval call
  sites (`fts5::execute_fts5_query`, `fts5::execute_like_query`,
  `fts5::execute_unfiltered_query`, `patterns::load_learnings_with_applicability`,
  `recall::load_ucb_fallback`) must format this const into their WHERE clauses
  alongside — never replacing — the existing `retired_at IS NULL` filter.
- **Vector backend filters in Rust, not SQL**: `vector.rs` loads embeddings
  directly, so supersession is enforced via `load_superseded_ids()` +
  `HashSet::contains` after the retrieval. Keep the two paths in sync when
  changing filter semantics.
- **Tests that touch `learning_supersessions` need `setup_db_with_migrations()`**
  — the plain `setup_db()` calls `create_schema()` only, which stops at v0.

## Recall Score Output

`task-mgr --format json recall` returns numeric scores alongside the categorical
`confidence` field so consumers can parse signal strength:

- `relevance_score` — raw retrieval score (FTS5 BM25, pattern-match points, or
  vector cosine similarity, depending on backend)
- `ucb_score` — UCB1 bandit score (present on `--for-task` queries)
- `combined_score` — aggregated ranking score used for ordering
- `match_reason` — human-readable explanation (e.g. `"FTS5 text match"`,
  `"file pattern match, task type match"`)

The underlying `recall_learnings()` / `recall_learnings_with_backend()` signatures
are unchanged; scored output flows through `recall_learnings_scored()` and the
existing CLI formatters.

## Embedding / Ollama Configuration

`curate embed` generates local embeddings via Ollama for the dedup pre-filter. Configure in `.task-mgr/config.json`:

```json
{
  "ollamaUrl": "http://localhost:11435",
  "embeddingModel": "hf.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v5-text-small-retrieval-GGUF:Q8_0"
}
```

- **Default URL**: `http://localhost:11435` (the bundled docker-compose stack
  remaps to 11435 to avoid clashing with a host-installed `ollama serve` on the
  upstream-default 11434)
- **Default model**: `hf.co/jinaai/jina-embeddings-v5-text-small-retrieval-GGUF:Q8_0` (1024 dimensions)
- **Schema**: Migration v15 adds `learning_embeddings` table (BLOB storage, little-endian f32)

### Graceful Degradation

- `curate dedup` works without Ollama — falls back to standard batch sizing when no embeddings exist
- `curate embed --status` only queries the DB (no Ollama connection needed)
- `curate embed` returns a clear error if Ollama is unreachable or the model is missing
- `recall --query <text>` HARD-FAILS by default if Ollama is unreachable. Pass
  `--allow-degraded` to fall back to silently-empty vector results (useful for
  offline runs). `recall --for-task <id>` (no `--query`) does not need Ollama.

### Reranker (optional)

The recall pipeline can layer a cross-encoder reranker on top of the per-backend
union slate. Reranking only fires for `recall --query <text>` (with or without
`--for-task`); `--for-task` alone runs the today's UCB-only pipeline.

Configure in `.task-mgr/config.json`:

```json
{
  "rerankerUrl": "http://localhost:8080",
  "rerankerModel": "jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual",
  "rerankerOverFetch": 3
}
```

- **`rerankerUrl`** — base URL of a [gpustack/llama-box](https://github.com/gpustack/llama-box)
  server exposing OpenAI-compatible `/v1/rerank`. Reranker is disabled when unset.
- **`rerankerModel`** — model name passed in the `model` field of the rerank
  request. Required alongside `rerankerUrl`; either-or disables rerank.
- **`rerankerOverFetch`** — per-backend over-fetch factor. Slate size is
  `min(limit * over_fetch, 30)`. Default `3`. Higher = better recall headroom,
  longer rerank latency.
- **Example llama-box invocation** (CPU, port 8080):

  ```sh
  llama-box --rerank-only --port 8080 \
      --model /models/jina-reranker-v2-base-multilingual.gguf
  ```

  See `docker/docker-compose.yml` for a full Docker setup that bundles Ollama
  embeddings + llama-box rerank, GPU-by-default with a `--profile cpu` fallback.

#### Soft-fail asymmetry

The reranker is a quality booster, not a correctness primitive: when the
server is unreachable, recall emits a `[warn]` line to stderr and returns the
un-reranked candidates with their original BM25/cosine/pattern scores. Recall
still exits `0`. Contrast with Ollama, which by default hard-fails because the
vector backend is part of the recall result, not just an ordering heuristic.

#### `--query "X" --for-task Y` interaction

When both are set:
1. Per-backend top-N union slate is fetched (FEAT-003's `retrieve_for_rerank`).
2. Cross-encoder reranks the slate by `(query, candidate)` similarity.
3. UCB tiebreaks within ±0.05 rerank-score bands (same band → higher UCB wins).
4. Slate is truncated to `--limit`.

`--for-task` alone (no `--query`) skips steps 1-3 entirely; the reranker is
NOT consulted.

## Dedup Dismissal Memory

`curate dedup` persists pairs the LLM has already examined and found distinct in the
`dedup_dismissals` table (migration v18: composite PK `(id_lo, id_hi)` **plus
`CHECK (id_lo < id_hi)`** for defense-in-depth, plus `idx_dedup_dismissals_hi`).
Subsequent runs skip batches whose every C(N,2) pair is already dismissed, so
users don't re-pay LLM calls for the same "no duplicates" output.

- **Pair normalization**: `normalize_pair()` canonicalizes `(a, b)` to `(min, max)`;
  all writes go through `record_dismissals()`. The v18 CHECK constraint backstops
  this at the schema level — a self-pair or reversed pair that slipped past Rust
  normalization fails at INSERT time rather than silently corrupting the table.
- **Narrow conflict suppression**: `record_dismissals` uses
  `ON CONFLICT (id_lo, id_hi) DO NOTHING`, **not** `INSERT OR IGNORE`. This keeps
  duplicates idempotent while letting CHECK (or any future NOT NULL / FK) failures
  propagate as real errors instead of being swallowed.
- **Multi-row INSERT**: `record_dismissals` emits a single
  `INSERT ... VALUES (?,?),(?,?),...` per chunk of 256 pairs (512 params,
  well under `SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER`). One round-trip per chunk, not per pair.
- **When dismissals are recorded**: after a successful LLM batch, every C(N,2) pair
  from the batch minus (a) pairs the LLM grouped as duplicates and (b) pairs whose
  IDs were retired by a strictly earlier batch.
- **Merge-map rewrite**: when the batch itself merges sources `{A,B}→N`, recorded
  pairs are rewritten via a per-batch `merge_map` so retired source IDs become the
  surviving merged ID. `(A,C)+(B,C)` collapse to `(N,C)`; two clusters in one batch
  `{A,B}→N1, {C,D}→N2` collapse the four cross-pairs to a single `(N1,N2)`. Without
  this rewrite the dismissals would point at retired (inert) rows and the next run
  would re-call the LLM on `(N, survivor)` pairs the LLM has effectively already
  judged. Logic lives in `compute_dismissal_pairs()` in `src/commands/curate/mod.rs`.
- **When they are NOT recorded**: `dry_run=true` (read-only convention) OR the batch
  raised an LLM error (can't trust a batch whose result we never got). The
  `continue` in the LLM error arm short-circuits before any dismissal accounting.
- **Forcing re-examination**: `task-mgr curate dedup --reset-dismissals` clears the
  table (`clear_dismissals()`) before the run; applies even with `--dry-run` because
  a reset is an administrative action, not an LLM pass.
- **`DedupResult.clusters_skipped`**: serde `default = 0` so JSON consumers parsing
  older output still work; new runs populate it with the count of batches skipped.
- Table has no foreign keys to `learnings` — rows for retired learnings are inert
  and harmless (they just never match an active cluster).

Helpers live in `src/commands/curate/mod.rs` as `pub(crate)` (not exported outside
the crate): `load_dismissals`, `record_dismissals`, `clear_dismissals`,
`is_fully_dismissed`, `compute_dismissal_pairs`, plus the private `normalize_pair`
/ `unordered_pairs`.

## Curate session cleanup workaround

Claude Code 2.1.110 writes an `ai-title` jsonl to `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<uuid>.jsonl`
even with `--no-session-persistence`. To avoid polluting the user's projects dir, `curate dedup`
and `curate enrich` opt into `spawn_claude`'s `cleanup_title_artifact` arg: a fixed UUID is
passed via `--session-id` (before `-p`, required — Claude parses flags only left of the prompt)
and, after `child.wait()` returns, that exact file is removed synchronously. An earlier detached
30s-delay thread design was replaced because threads die when the parent `task-mgr` process
exits; synchronous post-wait cleanup is both simpler and guaranteed to run. Scope is narrow —
loops and learning ingestion do NOT opt in; only the curate call sites do. See `spawn_claude`
and `cleanup_title_artifact_sync` in `src/loop_engine/claude.rs`.

## Soft-dep guard for milestone scheduling

`build_scored_candidates` in `src/commands/next/selection.rs` applies a **soft-dep
filter** after the formal `dependsOn` check. It defers any candidate whose
acceptance criteria reference a known spawned-fixup prefix
(`SPAWNED_FIXUP_PREFIXES = ["REFACTOR-N", "CODE-FIX", "WIRE-FIX", "IMPL-FIX"]`)
while a same-prefix `todo`/`in_progress` sibling still exists in the same PRD.
Defends against forgotten `--depended-on-by <milestone-id>` edges when the loop
spawns ad-hoc fixups in response to a milestone's AC text.

**Invariants for future maintainers:**

- **Token-aware exact-prefix matching, never loose substring**:
  `id_body_matches_prefix` requires the `{prefix}-` boundary at start-of-id OR
  after a `-`. Bare `id.contains("CODE-FIX")` would false-match `CODE-FIXTURE-1`
  — that's the regression the trailing dash exists to prevent.
- **AC writing convention**: the filter tokenizes acceptance-criteria text on
  non-`[A-Z0-9-]` chars and matches `token.starts_with("{prefix}-")`. Tokens
  must start with the bare prefix — an AC that writes a fully task-prefixed form
  like `cbd7d081-REFACTOR-N-xxx` tokenizes as one token starting with
  `cbd7d081-` and **silently bypasses** the guard. PRD authors who want the
  guard to fire should write the prefix as a standalone token (`REFACTOR-N-xxx`,
  `CODE-FIX-xxx`, etc.) — typically inside a parenthetical or slash-list as in
  `"Any spawned CODE-FIX/WIRE-FIX/IMPL-FIX/REFACTOR-N tasks have passes=true"`.
- **Self-fixup short-circuit**: `task_is_self_fixup` returns early so a
  `REFACTOR-N-001` candidate whose own AC mentions `REFACTOR-N-xxx` is never
  blocked. Sibling fixups remain co-schedulable across slots — this is the
  primary reason the guard fires only on milestone-class candidates.
- **`task_prefix` threading is mandatory**: `get_active_task_ids` mirrors
  `get_completed_task_ids` exactly — `prefix_and` clause + `archived_at IS NULL`.
  Omitting either is a known regression source: the prefix scoping is the only
  defense against PRD-A's milestone being blocked by PRD-B's active fixup, and
  archived rows must never block (they're inert).
- **`SPAWNED_FIXUP_PREFIXES` is the sole expansion point**: adding a new
  ad-hoc-spawn task type (e.g. `PERF-FIX`) requires extending this slice;
  `mentioned_fixup_prefixes` and `find_active_blockers_for_prefixes` iterate
  it directly, no other registration needed.

**Operator visibility**: a single `eprintln!` per deferred candidate
(`"Deferring <id>: AC references active fixup task(s): <sorted blocker IDs>"`)
fires at the filter site — not per-blocker, not per-AC-line. Sort order in
the message is stable for grep friendliness.

**Companion prompt-side teaching** (`src/loop_engine/prompt_sections/task_ops.rs`):
the loop agent is taught to pass `--depended-on-by <milestone-id>` when spawning
a fix in response to a milestone's AC. The selection-side guard is the catch;
the prompt-side teaching is the cause-fix. Both layers ship together by design
— neither is sufficient alone.

## Iteration pipeline (shared)

Sequential (`run_iteration`) and parallel-wave (`run_slot_iteration` +
`process_slot_result`) execution paths share a single post-Claude pipeline:
`process_iteration_output` in `src/loop_engine/iteration_pipeline.rs`. The
module-level rustdoc lists the steps in order (progress logging,
`<key-decision>` extraction, `<task-status>` dispatch, completion ladder
including the `is_task_reported_already_complete` fallback, learning
extraction, bandit feedback, per-task crash tracking) and the two engine.rs
call sites (sequential at ~3204 in `run_loop`, wave at ~1166 in
`process_slot_result`).

**Why a shared pipeline**: before this unification, wave mode silently
skipped behaviors the sequential path treated as core — slot output was
never extracted for new learnings, bandit feedback never updated, and the
completion fallback didn't fire. The single-pipeline contract makes
parity-divergence a compile-time concern (any new step is added in one
place; both call sites pick it up).

**Prompt-builder companion**: `src/loop_engine/prompt/mod.rs` documents the
three-builder layout (`core` / `sequential` / `slot`) plus the main-thread
bundle rule — slot prompts must be built on the main thread before
`thread::spawn` because `rusqlite::Connection` is `!Send`. A compile-time
`Send` assertion on `SlotPromptBundle` enforces this; sections added to the
sequential prompt MUST also be wired through the wave builder so the two
paths cannot drift again.

**Out of scope for the pipeline** (kept at the call sites): wrapper-commit,
external-git reconciliation, human-review trigger, rate-limit waits,
pause-signal handling, slot merge resolution (see "Slot merge-back conflict
resolution" below).

## Slot merge-back conflict resolution

When parallel-slot waves finish, `merge_slot_branches_with_resolver` (in
`src/loop_engine/worktree.rs`) runs `git merge --no-edit` from slot 0 for each ephemeral
slot branch. On a non-zero exit it lists the conflicted files and invokes a `MergeResolver`
(callback seam, `pub(crate) trait`); the engine wires `ClaudeMergeResolver` from
`src/loop_engine/merge_resolver.rs`, which spawns Claude in slot 0's already-conflicted
worktree (`PermissionMode::Auto`, `working_dir = slot0_path`, 600s timeout) with a prompt
that explicitly prohibits push, branch deletion, hard reset outside the merge, and history
rewrites. The resolver's `Resolved` claim is **never trusted**: the caller re-inspects
MERGE_HEAD and HEAD post-spawn and downgrades a lying resolver to `failed_slots` with a
forced `git reset --hard pre_merge_head`. `SlotFailureKind::ResolverAttempted` vs
`PreResolver` lets engine.rs pick the right warning text without string-sniffing.

Note: merge resolution is intentionally NOT part of the shared
`iteration_pipeline` (see "Iteration pipeline (shared)" above) — it requires
working-tree state owned by `run_wave_iteration`, not the per-slot
post-Claude processing block.

## Parallel-slot scheduling

Five layered defenses harden parallel-slot execution against the cascade
that produced the mw-datalake incident (a 2-slot loop whose slot-1
merge-back failed on iteration 1 with a recomputed-slot-path ENOENT,
silently kept launching new waves, and eventually diverged 22-vs-18
commits with un-merged `Cargo.lock` modifications on each side).

### 1. Slot path threading (cause-fix)

`merge_slot_branches_with_resolver` (`src/loop_engine/worktree.rs`) takes
`slot_paths: &[PathBuf]` and uses `slot_paths[0]` as slot 0's path, never
recomputing it via `compute_slot_worktree_path(project_root, branch, 0)`.
The recomputation diverges when the loop runs from inside the matching
worktree — `compute_slot_worktree_path` re-derives a path under
`{parent(project_root)}/{slot0_name}-worktrees/...` while the actual slot 0
worktree IS the project root. Engine threads the paths returned by
`ensure_slot_worktrees` through `WaveParams::slot_worktree_paths`.

`compute_slot_worktree_path` is still correct for slots 1+ inside
`merge_slot_branches_with_resolver` and for `cleanup_slot_worktrees` — only
the slot 0 lookup was wrong.

### 2. Consecutive-merge-fail halt threshold

`ProjectConfig::merge_fail_halt_threshold` (default `2`) caps consecutive
parallel-slot merge-back failure waves before the engine halts. Single
failures are recoverable (next wave gets a clean slate from the
resolver); two-in-a-row indicate a cascading state. The reset/halt
contract is implemented once in
`apply_merge_fail_reset_and_halt_check` (`src/loop_engine/engine.rs`)
and called from the wave-loop boundary — sequential-loop and wave-loop
paths must not re-implement it.

Threshold semantics:
- `0` — never halt (legacy "log and continue" behavior, preserved
  bit-for-bit on the same forced-fail input)
- `1` — halt on any merge-back failure
- `2` (default) — halt after two consecutive merge-back failure waves

### 3. Implicit-overlap baseline + buildy heuristic

`select_parallel_group` in `src/commands/next/selection.rs` serializes
shared-infra contention through a single synthetic `__shared_infra__`
slot per wave. A candidate "claims" the synthetic slot when ANY of:

- (a) some `touchesFiles` entry's basename matches the union of
  `IMPLICIT_OVERLAP_FILES` (Cargo.lock, uv.lock, package-lock.json,
  go.sum, etc. — Rust/Python/JS/Go ecosystems out-of-the-box) ∪
  `ProjectConfig::implicit_overlap_files` ∪
  `PrdFile::implicit_overlap_files` (project + PRD lists EXTEND, do not
  replace, the baseline);
- (b) the task id matches `BUILDY_TASK_PREFIXES` (`FEAT`, `REFACTOR`,
  `REFACTOR-N`, `CODE-FIX`, `WIRE-FIX`, `IMPL-FIX` — superset of
  `SPAWNED_FIXUP_PREFIXES`) via the same token-aware
  `id_body_matches_prefix` matcher used by the soft-dep guard (no
  parallel matcher);
- (c) the task's `claims_shared_infra` field (Option<bool>, migration
  v19) is `Some(true)` — explicit override.

`Some(false)` overrides BOTH (a) and (b); `None` falls through to (a) ∨
(b). This deliberately changes the empty-`touchesFiles` parallelism
baseline — buildy-prefix tasks claim infra even with no listed files.

### 4. Cross-wave file affinity (un-merged ephemeral branches)

`select_parallel_group` accepts `ephemeral_overlay: &[(branch, files)]`
listing files claimed by un-merged ephemeral slot branches from prior
waves. A candidate is deferred when its `touchesFiles` overlap with any
ephemeral branch's claimed set — preventing the same file from being
modified on two divergent branches across waves.

Engine builds the overlay via `worktree::list_unmerged_branch_files`
(`git diff --name-only {base}...{ephemeral}`) for each `{branch}-slot-N`
ephemeral that hasn't merged back. Empty overlay → identical results to
the pre-FEAT-004 implementation (strict superset filter).

**Deadlock guard**: when the greedy pass yields an empty group AND every
candidate's only overlap was ephemeral, `ParallelGroupResult::ephemeral_block_diagnostics`
is populated with named blocking branches. Engine treats this as
equivalent to `failed_merges` non-empty so the FEAT-002 reset/halt
contract fires and the loop halts cleanly with named branches instead
of spinning until stale-iteration abort.

### 5. Stale ephemeral branch hygiene at startup

`reconcile_stale_ephemeral_slots` (`src/loop_engine/worktree.rs`) runs
once at loop startup BEFORE `ensure_slot_worktrees`. For each
`{branch}-slot-N` left over from a prior crash:
- Clean (worktree dir gone, no un-merged commits) → branch deleted, no
  abort.
- Un-merged commits exist AND `halt_threshold > 0` → abort startup
  (the operator must reconcile before the new loop can run).
- Dirty working tree (uncommitted changes) → abort regardless of
  `halt_threshold` (no automated cleanup of unsaved work).

Branch-name shape uses `ephemeral_slot_branch(branch, slot)` (slot 0 is
the loop's base branch; slots 1+ are `{branch}-slot-{N}`). Idempotent —
running twice produces identical state on the second pass.

**Slot-0 SAFETY GUARD (load-bearing)**: `classify_ephemeral_branch`
returns `Err` when the parsed slot suffix is `0`, and
`list_ephemeral_slot_branches` filters `slot > 0`. Production code never
creates a `{branch}-slot-0` ref (slot 0 reuses the base branch directly
in `ensure_slot_worktrees`), but a stray ref from a buggy past version,
manual operator action, or recovery artifact would otherwise classify
as `CleanMerged` with `worktree_path` pointing at the **loop's main
worktree** — `compute_slot_worktree_path(_, branch, 0)` short-circuits
to `compute_worktree_path(_, branch)`. The downstream
`delete_merged_ephemeral` would then `git worktree remove` the loop's
running worktree. Guard MUST hold; never broaden the glob without
adding the slot==0 rejection at the same boundary.

### 6. Run-level config caching (restart required for mid-loop edits)

`ProjectConfig` and the PRD-side `implicit_overlap_files` override are
loaded ONCE at `run_loop` startup and threaded through
`WaveIterationParams` (`prd_implicit_overlap_files`, `project_config`).
`run_wave_iteration`, `apply_merge_fail_reset_and_halt_check`, and the
merge-back resolver setup all read from the cached references — never
call `read_project_config` or `read_prd_implicit_overlap_files` from
inside a wave hot path.

**Mid-loop edits to `.task-mgr/config.json` or the PRD JSON do NOT take
effect** — operators must restart the loop to apply config changes.
Same restart-required semantics every other run-scoped knob already
has (`parallel_slots`, `default_model`, `merge_resolver_*`).
Documenting this here so the next "I changed config and nothing
happened" question has a quick answer.

### 7. Failed-merge accounting: `Vec<FailedMerge>`, not parallel arrays

`WaveOutcome.failed_merges: Vec<FailedMerge>` carries `(slot, task_id)`
as a single struct so the slot/task pairing is a type-level invariant.
The earlier shape (parallel `Vec<usize>` + `Vec<Option<String>>` held
lockstep by rustdoc) was correct but implicit; mismatched lengths would
have silently truncated under `zip`. Don't reintroduce parallel arrays
here, and apply the same shape preference for any future
"slot + per-slot data" aggregation.

**Synthetic-deadlock sentinel (`SYNTHETIC_DEADLOCK_SLOT = usize::MAX`)**:
`handle_ephemeral_deadlock` inserts one entry with this slot index when
every blocking ephemeral branch had a malformed suffix
(`synth_slots.is_empty() && !diagnostics.is_empty()`). Without it,
`failed_merges` would be empty, `apply_merge_fail_reset_and_halt_check`
would reset `consecutive_merge_fail_waves` to 0, and the deadlock
guard would silently spin until the stale-iteration tracker aborted —
defeating the FEAT-002 cascade halt. The diagnostic step special-cases
the sentinel to print `<malformed deadlock blocker>` instead of
synthesizing `{branch}-slot-18446744073709551615`.

General pattern: **any synthesis that translates "we observed a
problem" into "produce a failure record" must always emit at least
one record, even if the upstream parsers all rejected the input** —
otherwise downstream "is_empty" checks invert the safety guarantee.
